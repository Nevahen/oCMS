## About this project

Angular 5 + NodeJS + MySQL based CMS taking form slowly. This is mainly for learning, so it should not be used for anything serious, as it may or may not work like expected. But maybe you can learn something, or shout at me and show me a right direction from this mess, if you happen to wander here.

**NOTE** Web client is not currently up to date with backend, so it doesn't work with current version.
